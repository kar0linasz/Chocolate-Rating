# Chocolate-Rating

Hello,

This is a simple and enjoyable analysis of kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/chocolate-ratings 👩‍💻 Technologies in use: SSMS, SQL, Power Bi

First, I created a new database in SSMS and uploaded the data downloaded from Kaggle. After that I analysed the data with the usage of SQL (👉 QUERY file). Then I connected the data with Power Bi via SQL Server and created some visuals. ✨ I also used graphic program to place chocolate in the dashboard 🍫😋
